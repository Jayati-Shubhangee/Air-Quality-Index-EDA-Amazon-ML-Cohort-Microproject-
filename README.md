## 📁 Dataset Overview

📌 **Dataset Name**: *Air Quality Index (India)*  
📍 **Source**: Provided in Amazon ML School Cohort
📊 **Features**:  
`City`, `Date`, `PM2.5`, `PM10`, `NO2`, `CO`, `SO2`, `AQI`, `AQI_Bucket`, etc.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

✅ Checked for null/missing values  
✅ Dropped or imputed missing pollutant values  
✅ Converted date formats for time series analysis  
✅ Removed outliers in AQI and pollutants where needed

---

## 📈 EDA Highlights

✨ **Visualization & Analysis** included:
- 🔸 City-wise Average AQI Ranking
- 📉 Monthly AQI Trends (Time-Series)
- 📊 Distribution of AQI Categories (Good, Poor, Severe)
- 🔥 Correlation Heatmap: Pollutants vs AQI
- 🌆 Pollution Insights across different cities and seasons

---

## 💡 Key Insights

🧠 **What we learned:**
- PM2.5 and PM10 are the strongest contributors to AQI rise  
- ❄️ Winters record higher AQI due to low dispersion  
- Cities in Northern India experience severe air pollution  
- Some cities have surprisingly cleaner air due to better regulations
